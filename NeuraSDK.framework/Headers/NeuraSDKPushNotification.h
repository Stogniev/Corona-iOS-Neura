 An app integrating Neura's SDK must support receiving push messages.
 
 Silent push messages are used as part of the data collection mechanism.

@interface NeuraSDKPushNotification : NSObject

/**
 Called to support the default configuration of Neura's push notifications mechanism.
 By default, this is called automatically for you after the user finishes a successfull authentication process.
 
 1) If you choose, you may call this method explicitly even before the authentication flow, allowing the user to agree to receive push notification earlier.
    This option allows you to control when to ask the user if she is interested to receive push notifications.
 
 2) If you want to explicitly configure push notifications in your app, you can set the setupDefaultPushNotificationsSupport flag to NO on the NeuraAuthenticationRequest object.
 
 Behind the scenes, this method doesn't do anything special. It just calls:
 if ([[UIApplication sharedApplication] isRegisteredForRemoteNotifications] == NO) {
    .
    .
    .
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerUserNotificationSettings:settings];
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotifications];
 }
 With these notification types in the settings: UIUserNotificationTypeAlert, UIUserNotificationTypeBadge, UIUserNotificationTypeSound.
 
 Neura is using silent push messages as part of the data collection processes.
 You can implement the push configuration on your own, by changing the flag setupDefaultPushNotificationsSupport on the authentication request object and calling
 [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotifications] on your own. 
 Just keep in mind you must call this, or Neura's data collection will not work as designed.
